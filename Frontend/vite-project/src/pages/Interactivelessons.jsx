      content: `**DEFINITION:** Climate change means a big and long-term change in the Earth's weather and temperature. It doesn't just mean one hot day ‚Äî it means the planet's average temperature is slowly increasing over many years. This is called global warming.

**REASON:** The main reason is the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
‚Ä¢ Main sources of gas: Burning coal, petrol, and diesel for electricity and transport
‚Ä¢ Cutting down trees (deforestation)
‚Ä¢ Factories and industries
‚Ä¢ Examples: Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), Methane (CH‚ÇÑ), Nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO)

**EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE:**
‚Ä¢ Ice in the Arctic and Antarctica is melting
‚Ä¢ Sea levels are rising, which can flood coastal areas
‚Ä¢ There are more heatwaves, droughts, and floods

**HOW CAN WE STOP CLIMATE CHANGE:**
‚Ä¢ Use less electricity ‚Äî turn off lights when not needed
‚Ä¢ Plant trees ‚Äî they absorb carbon dioxide
‚Ä¢ Use public transport or cycle/walk
‚Ä¢ Reduce plastic and waste
‚Ä¢ Use renewable energy like solar and wind`,

**TYPES OF WASTE:**
1. Biodegradable waste - can be broken down by nature (food scraps, paper)
2. Non-biodegradable waste - cannot be broken down naturally (plastic, glass)
3. Hazardous Waste - dangerous to health and environment (batteries, chemicals)
4. E-Waste (Electronic Waste) - old phones, computers, TVs

**IMPORTANCE OF WASTE MANAGEMENT:**
‚Ä¢ Keeps our surroundings clean and healthy ‚Äì Proper waste disposal prevents littering and bad smell
‚Ä¢ Reduces pollution ‚Äì Stops harmful gases, chemicals, and plastics from polluting air, water, and soil
‚Ä¢ Protects the environment ‚Äì Helps maintain a healthy ecosystem for plants, animals, and humans
‚Ä¢ Encourages recycling and reuse ‚Äì Saves raw materials and reduces the need for new resources

**HOW WASTE IS CAUSED:**
‚Ä¢ Waste is caused when people use things and throw them away instead of reusing or recycling them
‚Ä¢ Everyday activities like cooking, shopping, and working create garbage such as food waste, plastic, paper, and bottles
‚Ä¢ Factories also produce waste while making products
‚Ä¢ In cities, more people means more garbage from homes, shops`,
