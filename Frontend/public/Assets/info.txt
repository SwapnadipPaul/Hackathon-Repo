#Climate Changing

*DEFINATION:
       Climate change means a big and long-term change in the Earth’s weather and temperature. It doesn’t just mean one hot day — it means the planet’s average temperature is slowly increasing over many years. This is called global warming.

*REASON:
       The main reason is the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
       -Main sources of gas:   
           Burning coal, petrol, and diesel for electricity and transport
           down trees (deforestation)
           Factories and industries
           Waste and agriculture
      -for examples:
           Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
           Methane (CH₄)
           Nitrous oxide (N₂O)

*Effects of Climate Change:
       -Ice in the Arctic and Antarctica is melting
       -Sea levels are rising, which can flood coastal areas
       -There are more heatwaves, droughts, and floods
       -Animals and plants lose their homes
       -Farmers may have trouble growing crops
       -People may face health problems due to heat or poor air

Causes of Climate Change 
Climate change is caused by a combination of natural factors and human activities.
1. Natural Causes
•	Volcanic Eruptions: Release CO₂, ash, and other gases that can affect the climate.
•	Solar Variations: Changes in the sun’s energy output can influence global temperatures.
•	Earth’s Natural Cycles: Changes in Earth’s orbit, tilt, and ocean currents (like El Niño and La Niña) affect climate patterns.
•	Natural Greenhouse Effect: Greenhouse gases naturally trap heat to keep Earth warm, but variations can cause climate changes.
2. Human (Anthropogenic) Causes
•	Burning Fossil Fuels: Coal, oil, and natural gas release CO₂ and other greenhouse gases.
•	Deforestation and Land Use Changes: Cutting down forests reduces carbon absorption and releases stored CO₂.
•	Industrialization and Factory Emissions: Factories release CO₂, methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and harmful chemicals like CFCs.
•	Agriculture Practices:
o	Methane from livestock (cows, sheep).
o	Nitrous oxide from chemical fertilizers.
•	Urbanization and Transportation: Cars, planes, and construction increase CO₂ and heat in cities.
•	Waste and Landfills: Decomposition of organic waste produces methane.
•	Overconsumption and Resource Use: High energy use, deforestation, and industrial demand contribute to climate change.
3. Other Contributing Factors
•	Ozone Layer Depletion: Leads to more heat reaching Earth’s surface.
•	Pollution: Air pollutants like black carbon (soot) absorb sunlight and increase warming.
•	Melting Ice and Snow: Reduces reflection of sunlight (albedo effect), causing further warming.

*How Can We Stop Climate Change:
        -Use less electricity — turn off lights when not needed
        -Plant trees — they absorb carbon dioxide
        -Use public transport or cycle/walk
        -Reduce plastic and waste
        -Use renewable energy like solar and wind

*What Happens If We Ignore Climate Change
1. Rising Global Temperatures
•	The Earth will continue to heat up, causing more frequent and intense heatwaves.
•	Melting glaciers and polar ice will increase sea levels, flooding coastal areas.
2. Extreme Weather Events
•	Stronger storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and floods will become more common.
•	Increased droughts will affect agriculture and water supply.
3. Loss of Biodiversity
•	Many plants and animals may go extinct due to changing habitats and extreme weather.
•	Ecosystems like coral reefs, wetlands, and forests could collapse.
4. Food and Water Scarcity
•	Changing rainfall patterns and droughts will reduce crop yields.
•	Scarcity of freshwater will affect drinking water and irrigation.
5. Health Impacts
•	Increased heat-related illnesses, dehydration, and heat strokes.
•	Spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue due to changing climates.
•	Air pollution can worsen respiratory problems.
6. Economic Consequences
•	Damage to infrastructure from floods, storms, and heat.
•	Loss of livelihoods in agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.
•	Increased costs for disaster management and healthcare.
7. Social and Political Problems
•	Climate refugees may increase due to rising sea levels or droughts.
•	Conflicts over scarce resources like water and food.
•	Migration pressures on cities and countries.
